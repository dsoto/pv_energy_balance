This repo provides a simple energy balance model to estimate performance of a
solar photovoltaic system with a battery backup.

The tool is meant to be a comprehensible and extensible tool for testing different scenarios and configurations of off-grid solar power systems.  It makes many simplifying assumptions and is not meant to be a replacement for tools like HOMER.

Classes exist for an inverter, battery, panels, and clear sky insolation.

The basic behavior and usage can be seen in the following ipython notebook
files.
